      <p>
        The International Society for Universal Dialogue was founded in Warsaw,
        Poland in 1989. ISUD is a philosophical society dedicated to promoting
        international and intercultural dialogue among an ever-wider segment of
        humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main purpose of the society is to pursue, by means of scholarly
        work, the gradual realization of a decent, peaceful, and just world
        order. Towards this goal, ISUD produces biannual international
        conferences to facilitate an ethos of universal dialogue.
      </p>
      <p>
        ISUD is committed to promoting philosophical discourse intended to
        encourage the emergence of a more decent and humane world order by

      </p>
      <p>
        ISUD is a member of the International Federation of Philosophical
        Societies (FISP), is an international association of philosophers and

        archaeology, pedagogy, anthropology, etc) devoted to promoting the
        discussion of such fundamental issues as world peace, social justice,
        human rights, and dialogical interrelations of diverse cultures.

      <h2>Constitution of the International Society for Universal Dialogue</h2>
      <p>
        We the Members of the International Society for Universal Dialogue, in
        order to investigate and articulate the basic principles of universality
        systematically, rationally, and comprehensively—working to promote a
        world-wide understanding of these principles, striving to help generate
        universal world-consciousness towards the gradual emergence of a decent
        world order, and aspiring to actualize the highest and richest human
        values in art, science, politics, education, and social life—do agree to
        declare the following statement as the constitution of the International
        Society for Universal Dialogue.
      </p>

      <h2>Article I</h2>
      <p>
        The official name of the society shall be “The International Society for
        Universal Dialogue” to be incorporated in the state of Maine, USA.
      </p>

      <h2>Article II</h2>
      <p>
        Scholars, especially philosophers, from all the countries of the world
        without exception, are entitled to membership in the Society without any
        discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, nationality, religion,
        sexual preference, or social class. The democratic way of thinking and
        acting shall be the guiding principle of all decisions which determine
        the plans and projects of the Society.
      </p>

      <h2>Article III</h2>
      <p>
        The ISUD acknowledges that it was the idea of Universalism that gathered
        the Society together in Warsaw in November, 1989; and further
        acknowledges and honors its close relationship with the publication
        Dialogue and Universalism which provides a forum in which all members of
        ISUD have the opportunity to communicate and exchange their views.
      </p>

      <h2>Article III</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The Society shall be administered by a body of governors called the
          Board of the International Society of Universal Dialogue (ISUD); and
          it shall operate in concert with this Constitution, and with the
          decisions made by the ISUD General Assembly that meets prior to the
          tenure of a new Board.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Board includes an executive committee composed of four officers:
          Chair, Vice Chair, Secretary, and Treasurer; and it also includes a
          body of other members that number no fewer than six and no more than
          twelve. (So the full Board shall be no fewer than ten and no more than
          sixteen, including officers.) Board members are elected for one cycle
          (normally two years) to serve in a particular Board position, and have
          the possibility of being re-elected to one additional term in the same
          position. However, there must be at least one intervening cycle for a
          Board member to be reelected another time for the same position.
