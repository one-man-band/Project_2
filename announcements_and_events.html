      <h3>Call for Papers</h3>
      <h4>ISUD XII World Congress</h4>
      <h3>PHILOSOPHY IN AN AGE OF CRISIS: CHALLENGES AND PROSPECTS</h3>
      <h3>Lima, Peru</h3>
      <h4>July 10-15, 2018</h4>

      <p id="aae_body_1">
        The International Society for Universal Dialogue (ISUD) will hold its
        12th World Congress in Lima, Peru from 10 July until 15 July, 2018. The
        hosting institution is the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru
        (Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, PUCP).
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this World Congress is to promote dialogue concerning
        various crucial philosophical issues in today’s world and to explore the
        role of philosophy in our complicated times. The world we live in today
        faces many urgent issues that require sustained and productive
        cross-cultural dialogue. The ideals of global peace and security remain
        elusive while a sense of uncertainty pervades the dominant institutions
        of contemporary life. Traditional human values underlying our social and
        political institutions are continually transformed by new developments
        in information technology, digitalization, artificial intelligence, and
        the drive for economic efficiency. Although the globalization of trade
        and technology has brought people together as never before, our
        differing outlooks, habits, and ideologies continue to separate us.
      </p>
      <p>
        As philosophers, we must neither shut ourselves in ivory towers nor
        indulge ourselves with armchair philosophy. We must face the issues that
        define our moment in history. Our times demand that we, as philosophers,
        work to foster intellectual insight, imagination, social responsibility,
        and justice. Therefore, the International Society for Universal Dialogue
        issues a call for papers and proposals for panels for the 12th World
        Congress of ISUD on the general theme of “Philosophy in an Age of
        Crisis: Challenges and Prospects”, with the following sub-themes:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Philosophic innovation in a Promethean era</li>
        <li>The ivory tower and social involvement</li>
        <li>Cross-cultural dialogue and the building of common humanity</li>
        <li>Learning to be human in an age of crisis and uncertainty</li>
        <li>The Digital Revolution and the post-human</li>
        <li>The benefits and threats of technicization and science</li>
